# Student management System
* This uses asp.net MVC framework and MySQL database.
* This website keeps  track of student details in a MySQL database by implementing CRUD functionality.
* Identity framework is used to sign up, sign in and log out. ‘Admin’ role enables the admin to create, update, delete students & batches and assign a student to a batch. 
* A non-admin gets a read-only view of the students.
